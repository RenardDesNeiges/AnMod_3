\begin{enumerate}
    \item Plot a graph with several successful solutions as the ones shown in Figure 2 of Seyfarth et al.

            \label{stability_domain}
        \end{figure}
    \end{adjustwidth}

    \item Explain the trend you observe in the graph and its meaning from a biomechanics perspective.
    \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{}
        From the graph, we observe that the running gait is only stable on a limited domain of initial conditions (here we observe the evolution of stability as a function of spring stiffness $K$ and angle of attack $\alpha$, while using fixed) : the so called \textit{running domain}. On the graph we observe that the domain for which the model produces stable running are placed along a "J" shaped line with equation 
        \[ K \cdot (1 - \sin \alpha) = \text{const}. \]
        This result closely matches experimental data for leg-stiffness to angle of attack in human running as has been shown by Seyfarth et al. \cite{1}. This suggests that a simple model such as SLIP accurately captures the fundamental dynamics of running in biology.
    \end{adjustwidth}

    \item Do you think counting the number of steps is a good measure of stability? How can a Return Map (or Poincaré Map) be used to evaluate the system's stability? For more details on this method, please refer to the lecture notes as well as the reference.
